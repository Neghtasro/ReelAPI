ReelAPI is an attempt to create a quick and painless way to find movie
listings for Temple University's in house movie theather, The Reel.

Since I'm a novice programmer and this is my first Python application,
I have not yet written documentation, because I still haven't figured
out how to do everything yet. So far, the program scrapes, parses,
and formats until I have names and dates, but that's about it. Soon,
I should be able to wrap the listings in XML. Once I have something
that can be interfaced with, I will write any necessary documentation.

This project is still in heavy development, and won't be ready for use
for a while.
