ReelAPI is an attempt to create a quick and painless way to find movie
listings for Temple University's in house movie theather, The Reel.

ReelAPI currently has two methods of functionality. The default is to
return an XML formatted file to stdout, which seems to be how most web
frameworks like their data. Alternatively, it can be configured to write
an XML file to the system, which can be useful for unit testing(probably).

ReelAPI was developed by John Shaw in July of 2011. If you for some reason
think any part of this code was well-written, you are insane, but you are free
to use it, as long as you give proper credit.

ReelAPI uses BeautifulSoup as its HTML parser. This means you will need to have
BeautifulSoup installed or packaged with it if you plan to use it. BeautifulSoup
can be found here: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/

The content that ReelAPI scrapes from is owned by Temple University. The content
itself is owned by whoever owns it, not me, unless I made a movie being shown the
The Reel, which I don't plan on doing, so it's safe to say I don't own it.
